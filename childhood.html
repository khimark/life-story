        <p>One of my childhood memories is when my dad used to buy me two sauges before going to school.That really worked miracles on my pre-primary education. The action would leave me looking forward to the next school day.
        
        <p>Families from both my parents side have always cherished the tradition of meeting up each year. This made the bond among the cousins stronger, which later came in handy when time of need.
        
        <p>My parents effort to give we their children a better life has always been my motivation. It has always left me wanting to up my game and achieve more of what they have already achieved.
